Installing OW Module Forms extension
=========================================

1. Download the owmoduleforms package.

   Windows users should download the "zip" package. Linux/UNIX/OS X users may
   download any package format as long as the necessary unpacking tools are
   available.

2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZ Publish installation.

3. Unpack the files in the distribution.

   Windows users should unzip the files. The 'ezoe' directory will be created
   inside the 'extension' directory.

   Linux users may use of the following commands depending on the file type:
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf owmoduleforms-[ExtensionVersion].tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf owmoduleforms-[ExtensionVersion].bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip owmoduleforms-[ExtensionVersion].zip

4. Enable the ezoe extension in eZ Publish.

   To enable owmoduleforms for all of your siteaccesses, log in to your eZ Publish
   administration interface, click on the 'Setup' tab, and then click
   'Extensions' on the left. You will see the list of available extensions.
   Select the 'owmoduleforms' item and click the 'Apply changes' button.
   Aternatively, you can also edit the file 'site.ini.append.php' located
   in the 'settings/override' directory. Add the following line under
   the [ExtensionSettings] section:

   ActiveExtensions[]=owmoduleforms

   Create the file and/or the section if they do not exist.

   To make owmoduleforms works fine with ezjscore, owmoduleforms must be enabled after ezjscore extension.
   The final result must follow the following principle : 
   
     [ExtensionSettings]
     ActiveExtensions[]=ezjscore
     ActiveExtensions[]=owmoduleforms

5. Regenerate autoload array

   Update the class autoloads by running the script:
   $ php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php

6. Clear all the eZ Publish caches.

   Log in to your eZ Publish administration interface, select the 'Setup' tab,
   and then click the 'Clear all caches' button. If you use eZ Publish 3.6
   or higher, you can also use the developer toolbar (if enabled) located
   in the right hand side. Simply select 'All caches' from the drop-down list
   and click the 'Clear' button.

   Alternativly if you have PHP CLI installed, you can also do the following:

   $ ./bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all

   [eZJSCore]
   PreferredLibrary=jquery
